    "instagram_open" | "facebook_open" | "weather=show",
    "userInput": "<original user input>" {only remove your name from userinput if exists} and agar kisi ne google ya youtube pe kuch search karne ko bola hai toh
     userInput me only wo search wala text jaye,
     "response":"<a short spoken response to read out loud to the user>"
     }
